  <p>My favorite beverage is matcha. I honestly didn’t expect to like it, but now it’s the only thing I order. It tastes earthy but in a good way, and when it’s mixed with milk it’s super smooth and creamy. It kind of reminds me of banana pudding because it’s soft and not too sweet. I usually get it iced, especially when I’m out studying or just hanging with friends. It gives me energy without making me feel all jittery like coffee does. I just like that it’s simple but still really good
